    Hi! Welcome to my site.
    I'm currently residing in Bangalore.
    I'm 23 years old.
    I graduated from SVCE in ISE.
    I've built few remote websites as a part of my mini project using HTML, CSS, PHP and JS.
    I'm interested in watching movies/series and also love cooking during leisure.
