    <h1>Progressive Web Apps</h1>

    <img src="pwebapps.jpg">

    <p  class="section-1">A Progressive Web App is an app that can provide additional features based on what the device supports, 
        providing offline capability, push notifications, almost native app look and speed and local caching of resources.
        This is always considerably easier and cheaper than building native applications, especially when considering the implications of building and maintaining cross-platform apps.
        Mobile platforms offer increasing support for Progressive Web Apps. 
        They even ask the user to add the app to the home screen when that user visits such a site.
    </p>

        <h2 class="section-2">Progressive Web Apps Alternatives</h2>

        <h3>Native Mobile Apps</h3>
        <p>Native mobile apps are the most obvious way to build a mobile app. Objective-C or Swift on iOS, Java /Kotlin on Android and C# on Windows Phone.
            The main pain point with native apps is that cross-platform development requires learning, mastering and keeping up to date with many different methodologies and best practices. 
            If, for example, you have a small team or you’re a solo developer building an app on 3 platforms, you need to spend a lot of time learning the technology and environment. 
            You’ll also spend a lot of time managing different libraries and using different workflows.
        </p>

        <h3>Hybrid Apps</h3>
        <p>
            Hybrid applications are built using Web Technologies, but are deployed to the App Store. 
            The key aspect of Hybrid Apps is the write once, run anywhere concept.
            The different platform code is generated at build time, and you’re building apps using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, which is amazing. 
            The device capabilities such as microphone, camera, network, GPS etc are exposed through JavaScript APIs.

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>You would need to serve your web app through HTTPS with a security certificate. 
            Developers must ensure that online users have a secure connection to your web applications and work towards safeguarding data transfer between them and the server.
            It is pertinent that you use HTTPS, which marks your site as secure. Customers can rest assured of safe payment transactions, 
            secure user accounts, and private communications and identity.</p>

        <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
        <p>
            Web applications are not search-engine-friendly by default. You would need to overcome numerous technical challenges in making sure that web apps are discoverable
            Here are some of the SEO best practices:
            To avoid duplication provide canonical tag when serving content from various online sources.
            Make sure the page doesn’t use fragmented identifiers as Google will ignore them.
            Make use of Fetch as Google tool to test how Google indexes your web applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Reporting & Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            With integrated analytics, you can get critical insights on user behavior patterns and the overall performance of your web app. 
            You can now keep track of all such data and optimize your web apps for higher engagement and better conversion.
        </p>

        <h3>Mobile-First Interface</h3>
        <p class="last">
            Enterprise web apps require a shift from conventional web design thinking. Why? Users today rely more on smartphones and tablets.
            According to a survey, only 27% of respondents used a laptop or desktop to connect to the internet away from work.
            However, 56% used a smartphone to access the internet. It is quite evident that your customers are comfortable using mobile.
            Developers may consider aligning components with a mobile device’s unique features and make the web app responsive.
            Basically, your app’s display should automatically adjust to whatever screen users are accessing it on.
